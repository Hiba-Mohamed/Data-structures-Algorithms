public class ArrayLists {
    
}
// Array list underneath array list is using arrays.
// But the difference noun is this. With array list you can dynamically add and remove.
// Space, or what's the name like so you can dynamically resize the array.
// So you have 10 now, assuming you want to add 11th element, what happens?
// It will dynamically resize this array.
// It would add to create.
// One with 15.
// So it does add an additional 5 to it which is.
// So it increases the size by 5. The initial capacity is 10, but if you want to add additional elements then it increases.
// By 5 a factor of 5.
// So right now you can copy 1234567891011.
// So this is the initial capacity, whatever this is, OK.
// And then it would increase again.
// So here we come null and all of that null, null, null. So as you keep adding more elements into the array list it just increases by a factor of 5.
// If you decide to remove.
// An element or this?
// It is still going to be the same.
// You still going to have this until you call a certain method and I'll be showing you.
// Until you call what we call trim to size.
// Trim to size, trim to size is a method within the array list.
// It is only then and then that it will resize the entire space block to match the number of elements.
// So array list is basically an interface or it's a very great implementation of the array that has a lot of methods that helps you to easily use arrays.
// OK.
// So the take away from this particular class is that with array list it has a dynamic size.
// With arrays it is fixed. That's wonderful.
// Then the second difference is that with arrays you do have.
// With array list there is a performance issue.
// Because it's going to be because you're going to be copying data from one location to the other and then increasing the size.
// There is a performance overhead. OK, so that is also that for the difference. The third difference is that when you create an.
// Ari, usually when you create an array you determine the data type you want to store.
// So even it's an integer. Then once you declare the array, you can only store integers.
